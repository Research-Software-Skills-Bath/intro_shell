    "## Scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to Balena, Janus, the phase 1 cloud HPC service uses a scheduler to manage how jobs are run and resources are allocated. \n",
    "\n",
    "If multiple jobs ran on a single node at the same time users would be competing for the same resources and jobs take longer to run overall. A scheduler manages individual jobs, which are allocated to the resources they need as they become available. This results in a higher overall throughput and more consistent performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler used by Janus is the same as that used by Balena, `slurm`: _**S**_imple _**L**_inux _**U**_tility for _**R**_esource _**M**_anagment.\n"
