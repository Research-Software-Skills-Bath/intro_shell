    "    - Code/scripts for your calculations\n",
    "    - Template jobscripts\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```/campaign/```: 16TB Azure NetApp Files Standard. This is mid performance filesystem which should be used for files required during your current project workflow, for example any datasets you require to complete the current project thrust you are working on. It is <font size=\"3\">**not backed up**</font>, and should not be used for storing important results. You should ensure you have the capacity elsewhere to back up any important data. This space should be used for staging data to the ```/scratch/``` space during a calculation, which should then be moved off the ```/scratch/``` area and back to campaign following completion of the run. This space can be accessed from both the login and compute nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```/scratch/```: 16TB Azure NetApps Files Ultra. This is a high performance filesytem which can be used during your calculation runs. There is no quota, **however** because of the high associated cost with this storage type there is limited space for all users. You should stage your data required for a run from ```/campaign/``` into this space. Data should only be left on ```/scratch/``` during an active run, and should be copied back to ```/campaign``` following its successful completion. It is <font size=\"3\">**not backed up**</font> and should not be used for storing data. This psace can be accessed from both the login and compute nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```/apps/```: 1TB Azure managed Disk. This space contains centrally compiled software for use of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```/u/```: The University `H` drive is mounted and can be accessed from the login nodes only.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```/mnt/resource/```: Some compute instances have fast local storage located in this area, only accessible from the compute node. e.g. HBv3 (450GB), HBv2(450GB), HB(450GB), HC44(650GB) \n"
