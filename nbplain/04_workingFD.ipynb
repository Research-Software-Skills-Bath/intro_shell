    "`*` is a wildcard. It matches zero or more characters, so `*.pdb` matches `ethane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`, and every file that ends with '.pdb'. On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only matches `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front only matches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.\n",
    "\n",
    "`?` is also a wildcard, but it only matches a single character. This means that `p?.pdb` would match `pi.pdb` or `p5.pdb` (if we had these two files in the molecules directory), but not `propane.pdb`. We can use any number of wildcards at a time: for example, `p*.p?*` matches anything that starts with a 'p' and ends with '.', 'p', and at least one more character (since the `?` has to match one character, and the final `*` can match any number of characters). Thus, `p*.p?*` would match `preferred.practice`, and even `p.pi` (since the first `*` can match no characters at all), but not `quality.practice` (doesn't start with 'p') or `preferred.p` (there isn't at least one character after the '.p').\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames before running the command that was asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command as it is. For example typing `ls *.pdf` in the molecules directory (which contains only files with names ending with `.pdb`) results in an error message that there is no file called `*.pdf`. However, generally commands like `wc` and `ls` see the lists of file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with expanding wildcards."
